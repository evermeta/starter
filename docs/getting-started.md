# Getting Started

## Overview

This is the documentation for our API service built with Express and TypeScript.

## Architecture

Our application follows a layered architecture:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests
- Services: Contain business logic
- Repositories: Handle data access
- DTOs: Define data transfer objects
- Models: Define database entities

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment variables
3. Start the server: `npm run start`
